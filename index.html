        <p>[Intro: DJ Khaled]
            They try to play us, they play themselves
            (808 Mafia) This the intro
            For all you fuckboys that ever doubted the Migos
            You played yourself! (Another one)
            Fuckboy, bow down
        </p>
        
        <p>
            [Chorus: Takeoff & DJ Khaled]
            Spin off in the coupe, typhoon (Skrt skrt)
            I act an ass, baboon
            Wrappin' that dope, cocoon
            Young rich nigga in the room
            Finesse a nigga, no raccoon
            Spendin' M&M's in June
            Took a trip to Cancun
            CULTURE album comin' soon (Another one)
        </p>

        <p>
            [Verse 1: Quavo]
            Yeah, I bought the Benz off the lot
            Just to give your ho a lift
            I'm havin' the sauce in the refrigerator
            Just make sure you bring the chips
            Ayy, it's a fuck nigga in the back
            Just look at him, look at him plot
            He prolly think it's a club light
            But really it's the red dot
        </p>

        <p>
            [Verse 2: Takeoff]
            Fucked a bitch and hit the lot (Lot)
            Nigga fumblin' with the pot (Pot)
            I broke my wrist in the pot (Pot)
            Hit the block, brought back a knot (Knot)
            JJ Watt is on the block (Woop woop)
            Kept me runnin' from the cops (Cops)
            Don't buy the car, we want the lot (Skrt skrt)
            I need everything in stock (Stock)
            Act pints in the attic
            Pussy niggas puttin' on an act (Act)
            Fucked the bitch and broke her back
            I fucked the bitch and gave her back
            Thumbin' through a hundred
            Thumbin' through a hundred racks
            Know you ain't one hundred
            Your chain might get snatched
            I wanna whip up some pies today
            How many niggas gon' ride today?
            How many niggas gon' slide and grab on they nine
            When I say it's time to slay?
            Jump in the crowd and get live today
            Heard you talkin' through the wire today
            I'ma pull up with that fire, aim at his eye
            I bet he gon' die today
        </p>

        <p>
            [Verse 3: Quavo]
            Yeah, screw that lil' tip on that dirty lil' Uzi (Yeah)
            I put a seven in a thot coochie (Yeah)
            Niggas get money, don't know how to use it (Yeah, uh)
            I whipped up the babies, Harambe, abused it
        </p>

        <p>
            [Verse 4: Offset]
            The value went up in the stocks
            Tired of runnin' from the cops (12)
            Pourin' lean on the rocks (Mud)
            Mink fur, that's a fox (Vrrt)
            Quarter million in the vault (Quarter K)
            I'ma let the semi talk (Whole K)
            Now he swimmin' with the dolphins (Dolphins)
            Perky got me feelin' nauseous
            Don't come around with the nonsense (Uh-uh)
